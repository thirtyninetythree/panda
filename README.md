# Panda: Transparent Carbon Capture Measurement with Satellites and Smart Contracts
This project aims to introduce a transparent and verifiable approach to measuring carbon capture using satellite data and blockchain(chainlink) technology. Using satellite imagery, you estimate the amount of tree cover and carbon capture ability of a piece of land. This information is then fed into the blockchain via chainlink, which uses it to calculate the number of carbon tokens based on the current price on the market in a secure and transparent way. This tokens can be minted and sold on the blockchain ensuring  the provenance and authenticity of each carbon credit. 

# TO DO
- Improve the calculations to include different species and capacities of different trees
- Storing the satellite data on-chain, to make audits easier
